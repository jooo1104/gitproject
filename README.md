# pygit

**Just enough of a Git client to create a repo, commit, and push itself to GitHub.**

This project is a minimal Git client written in Python, inspired by [Ben Hoytâ€™s pygit](https://benhoyt.com/writings/pygit/). It demonstrates how to build a tiny version of Git from scratch with just enough functionality to:

- Initialize a repository
- Commit changes
- Push commits to GitHub

This is ideal for learning how Git works under the hood and for experimenting with Pythonâ€™s file I/O and subprocesses.
